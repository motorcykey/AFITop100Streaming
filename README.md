# AFITop100Streaming

A quick NodeJS/Express site that you can load to find out if any of the films on the AFI Top 100 are currently streaming

## How to Load

* Download NodeJS (this was created & tested on v8.16.2)
https://nodejs.org/en/
* Either use Git to clone the repository or download the ZIP from `Clone or download` button above
* Open Terminal (MacOS) or Command Line (Windows) and change directories to the folder where you've downloaded (and unzipped) your files
* Run `npm install` to install the project's Node dependencies (this only needs to be performed once, and will create a `node_modules` directory in your current folder)
* Once the installation completes, run `node app.js` to run the application and start the Express server
* Navigate to `http://localhost:9000` in a browser and you're done!
